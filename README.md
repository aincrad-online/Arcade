### Description


### App Evaluation

- **Story:** User plays game where they control a ship and shoot rocks/enemies while attempting to get a high score.
- **Market:** Availible for all ages. The users are not connected, so there will be no communication. 
- **Habit:** This app can be used when users are bored and need something to help them pass the time by.
- **Scope:** The user would first start with few, slow rocks and no enemies. As the game progresses, the rocks will increase in number and speed. The enemies will do so as well.
